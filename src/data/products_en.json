    "category": "Composite Material Sizing Agents",
    "typical_properties": {
      "appearance": "Milky white liquid",
      "ionic_type": "Anionic/Non-ionic composite",
      "stability": "No delamination or oil floating at 3000rpm",
      "water_solubility": "Infinite miscibility with water"
    },
    "product_introduction": "This product is a high-performance special modified macromolecular polyurethane polymer emulsion. Compared with traditional sizing agents, it has excellent positive synergistic effects, with smoother feel after bundling, effectively enhancing adhesion between fibers and bundle hardness. Short-cut glass fiber materials treated with this product have thermoplastic properties and good compatibility with thermoplastic materials such as PA and PE, with good dispersibility in composite material systems, significantly improving the mechanical properties and wear resistance of composite materials.",
    "features": [
      "Improved adhesion: The main function is to improve the adhesion between carbon fibers and resins, prevent delamination and increase strength.",
      "Enhanced mechanical properties: By improving fiber-matrix bonding, the sizing agent can increase the tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact strength of composite materials.",
      "Improved durability: Better adhesion and reduced water absorption provide better resistance to humidity, chemicals, and other environmental factors."
    ],
    "how_to_use": [
      "When used as a carbon fiber sizing agent, it is recommended to dilute with water. It is recommended to add 3-8 times water for dilution and stir evenly.",
      "After diluting the sizing agent, add it to the sizing bath. The initial concentration can be slightly higher.",
      "As the number of short-cut carbon fiber sizing agent uses increases, the concentration of the agent in the sizing bath gradually decreases. It is necessary to regularly supplement the diluted agent, recommended to supplement once every 1-3 cycles.",
      "The diluted agent should be used as soon as possible and not stored for long periods."
    ],
    "typical_applications": [
      "Aerospace field: Aircraft fuselage, wings, tail fins and other main load-bearing structural components, spacecraft cabins, satellite supports, etc.",
      "Wind power field: Wind turbine blades. Blades need to withstand long-term alternating loads and humid environments. The sizing agent needs to improve the interfacial fatigue resistance and water resistance between carbon fibers and epoxy resins, optimizing fiber bundling.",
      "New energy vehicle field: Body frames, chassis components, battery housings, etc.",
      "Textile weaving: Carbon fiber tows need to be woven into fabrics or braided into tubular shapes. The sizing agent improves bundling and anti-friction properties, reduces fly and breakage during weaving, ensuring fabric uniformity.",
      "Pipes: In the winding process of pipes and other products, the sizing agent reduces friction between fibers, making the tows neatly arranged during winding, avoiding performance fluctuations due to uneven tension."

    "product_introduction": "This product is a water-dilutable bladder lubricant release agent specifically designed for tire production. It can directly replace Dow Corning's DOWSIL FBL-3289 and is mainly used for demolding and lubrication during tire vulcanization molding processes.",
    "features": [
      "Excellent and flexibly adjustable release performance",
      "Strong compatibility with various formulations and processes",
      "Extends bladder service life and reduces production costs",
      "High cost-performance ratio, can replace imported products"
    ],
    "how_to_use": [
      "Standalone use: According to dilution ratio (water amount adjustment) and differences in vulcanized rubber formulation processes, 1-10 demolding cycles can be achieved. This method is suitable for scenarios requiring fewer demolding cycles",
      "Combined use (semi-permanent/permanent demolding): Mix with 40% hydrogen-containing silicone oil emulsion (crosslinking agent) in specific proportions to form a complete demolding coating system. Can significantly increase demolding cycle times, achieving \"semi-permanent/permanent demolding\", which is the preferred solution for high-frequency production scenarios"
