    "product_introduction": "This product can be used as a spray modifier, foliar penetration promoter, and spreading agent. It is widely used in herbicides, foliar fertilizers, plant growth regulators, insecticides, and fungicides. It does not decompose pesticide active ingredients, significantly reduces solution surface tension, and enhances the wetting, penetration, adhesion, and spreading ability of pesticide solutions on plant leaves or insect bodies, significantly improving efficacy, reducing pesticide application amounts, reducing application frequency, saving water, reducing pesticide pollution, and protecting the environment.",
    "features": [
      "Spreading: Contains nonionic surfactants, helps improve pesticide and fertilizer efficacy, saves time, improves droplet contact with plant or insect body surfaces, with excellent spreading performance.",
      "Penetration: After field application, droplets dry quickly on leaf and fruit surfaces, remain dry, effectively preventing pesticide volatilization and loss. In rainy and foggy weather, leaf and fruit surfaces are not prone to water accumulation, preventing pathogen spore germination in high humidity environments.",
      "Cost reduction: Improves efficacy, reduces pesticide usage, lowers pesticide application amounts, reduces application frequency."
